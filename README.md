1.	I’ve created S3 bucket with public access and saved one file with data – 
“epi indicators-all ears.csv”
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/ivote/?region=us-east-2&tab=overview

2.	Created a new election.ipynb file and read two csv files with data sources: 1) saved by Mike on Github, created df.
2) abovementioned file saved on aws.amazon.com, created df1.

3.	Collaborated with Hannah, so we prepared cleaned data for the df – first file with data (Hannah) and df1 – second file with data and implemented Linear Regression Model.
