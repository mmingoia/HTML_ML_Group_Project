# Election Turnout Analysis

One of the reasons our team chose the topic of “Election Turnup Analysis” was because we think this is something interesting concerning the USA elections. When discussing this topic with the team we asked ourselves how high the voter Turnout in the elections is and why has this number not been able to change in a long time.
