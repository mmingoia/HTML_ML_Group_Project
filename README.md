#questions

The question we hope to answer is, "What factors contribute to voter turnout in the United States?".
We hope to analyze this question further by answering the following questions:
"What are each states policies on voting?"
"What is the statistics of early voters?"
"What are the policies for early voting in each state?"
"Do demographics impact election results?"

We hope to answer these questions to analyize the impact voter turnout has had on the recent US elections

We are gathering our data from various sources including but not limited to US Census Bureau, also gathering data from various credible sites. Allowing us to get the most accurate and true data possible.
