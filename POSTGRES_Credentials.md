### Credentials needed to connect to our DataBase using PGAdmin4 & PostGres

RDS Endpoint Link (Copy this into Host name/address in "Connection"): 
provisionaldb2.cpvxmi357s0k.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com

username: postgres
password postgres

#### Where to see our provisional master table
Provisional Master table is in the "GroupProjectDB" and is in the "public" schema. The table is called "ProvisionalMaster"

### UPDATED 10/20/20
The RDS instance in AWS vanished suddenly! So I have updated the credentials here with the new Endpoint and mapping on where to go.
